bumper node: /mobile_base/events/bumper is when bumper event happens
	Message type is kobuki_msgs/BumperEvent
/mobile_base/sensors/bump_pc might be constant source?

For all of the others there is /mobile_base/events/stuff
and /mobile_base/sensors/stuff
Screenshot included.


The kobuki has 3 bumpers


What does "call the file kobuki_bumpers" mean?

Wheel event is cliff?
/mobile_base/events/fliff/
